## Introduction
Patient no-shows permeate medical practices, across specialties, locations, and practice models. While no-shows consistently cause problems for practices, not all practices track their no-show rate or realize the impact that even a couple daily no-shows can have on both their processes and their revenue. 
What is a patient no-show? A patient no-show refers to a missed patient appointment wherein the patient was scheduled, did not appear for the appointments, and made no prior contact with the clinic staff.

- [Patient no-shows cost the US healthcare industry $150 billion annually](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2013/02/24/No-shows-cost-health-care-system-billions/stories/201302240381)
- For a primary care physician, each missed appointment equals roughly $150-$200 in lost revenue. For surgeons, this is closer to $500.
- Patients who fail to show up for their appointments often require more expensive emergency care later on. These higher costs get factored into healthcare costs for everyone else

Because of this, a Machine Learning Classifier was developed in an attempt to predict if a patient will show or not a scheduled appointment by analysing other independent variables such as Age, Gender, etc.
